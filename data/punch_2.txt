THE THIRD-CLASS TRAVELLER'S PETITION

  (1845)

  Pity the sorrows of a third-class man,
    Whose trembling limbs with snow are whitened o'er,
  Who for his fare has paid you all he can:
    Cover him in, and let him freeze no more!

  This dripping hat my roofless pen bespeaks,
    So does the puddle reaching to my knees;
  Behold my pinch'd red nose--my shrivell'd cheeks:
    You should not have such carriages as these.

  In vain I stamp to warm my aching feet,
    I only paddle in a pool of slush;
  My stiffen'd hands in vain I blow and beat;
    Tears from my eyes congealing as they gush.

  Keen blows the wind; the sleet comes pelting down,
    And here I'm standing in the open air!
  Long is my dreary journey up to Town,
    That is, alive, if ever I get there.

  Oh! from the weather, when it snows and rains,
    You might as well, at least, defend the poor;
  It would not cost you much, with all your gains:
    Cover us in, and luck attend your store.

THE ORIGIN OF RAILWAYS.--The first idea of railways is of very ancient
date, for we hear of the Great Norman line immediately after the
Conquest.

       *       *       *       *       *

RAILWAY NEWS.--There is an old lady who says, that she always likes to
travel by a trunk line, because then she feels confidence about the
safety of her luggage.

RAILWAY REFORM.--Compartments to be reserved for ladies over and under a
certain age.

As there will invariably be compartments for those who smoke, so also
for those who snuff. The former will be labelled as usual "for Smokers,"
the latter "for Snuffers." The last-mentioned will be tried as far as
Hampton Wick.

The "Sleeping Cars" will be divided into "Snorers" and "Non-Snorers."
Tickets will be issued subject to these regulations.

It is important to the Shareholders to know that on and after the
abolition of the Second Class, the motto of the Company will be "No
Returns."

THE SLOW TRAIN

  On Southern lines the trains which crawl
    Deliberately to and fro
  Make life a burden; of them all
    This is the slowest of the slow.
  Impatiently condemned to bear
    What is indeed an awful bore,
  I've seemed to be imprisoned there
                Three days, or more.

  The angry passengers complain;
    Of new electric cabs they talk.
  They sit and swear at such a train,
    And ask, "Shall we get out and walk?"
  It's true the time seems extra long
    When spent in such a wretched way,
  My calculation may be wrong--
                Three hours, say.

  The other day I had to come
    By this slow train, but facing me
  Was no old buffer, dull and dumb;
    I chatted with my vis-à-vis.
  A pretty smile, a pretty dress,
    Gay spirits no fatigue could crush;
  With her it was a quick express,
                Three minutes' rush.

  For once I sadly left the train,
    For once the time too quickly passed.
  I still could angrily complain,
    Why travel so absurdly fast?
  At lightning speed that special went
    (I'd paid the ordinary fare),
  Now looking back it seems we spent
                Three seconds there.

train take me to Queen's Road, Bayswater?

SCENE--_Interior of Third-Class Smoking Compartment. First Passenger,
apparently a small Suburban Tradesman, of a full and comfortable habit,
seated by window. To him enters a seedy but burly Stranger, in a state
of muzzy affability, with an under-suggestion of quarrelsomeness._

_The Stranger (leaning forward mysteriously)._ Yer saw that gentleman I
was a torkin' to as I got in? Did yer know 'oo he _was_?

_First Passenger (without hauteur, but with the air of a person who
sets a certain value on his conversation)._ Well, he didn't look much
like the Archbishop of Canterbury.

_The S._ He's a better man than _'im_! That was Brasher, the middling
weight! he giv' me the orfice straight about Killivan and Smifton, _he_
did!

_First P. (interested, as a lover of the Noble Art of Self Defence)._
Ah! did he, though?

_The S._ He _did_; I went up to him, and I sez, "Excuse me," I sez,
like that, I sez, "but are you an American, or a German?"

_First P. (with superiority)._ He wouldn't like that--being taken for a
German.

_The S. (solemnly)._ Those were my very words! And he sez, "No, I'm a
Yank," and then I knoo 'oo 'e was, d'ye see? and so (_hazily_) one word
brought up another, and we got a torkin'. If I was to tell you I'd
_seen_ Killivan, I should be tellin' yer a lie!

_First P._ Well, I won't ask you to do that.

_The S. (firmly)._ Nor I wouldn't. But you've on'y to look at Smifton to
see 'e's never 'ad a smack on the 'ed. Now, there's Sulton--'e's a
_good_ man, _'e_ is--'e _is_ a good man! Look 'ow that feller knocks
'isself about! But if I was to pass _my_ opinion, it 'ud be
this--Killivan's _in_ it for science, he ain't in it to _take_ anything;
you may take that from me!

_First P._ (_objecting to be treated as an_ ingénu). It's not the first
time I've heard of it, by a long way.

_The S._ Ah! and it's the truth, the Bible truth (_putting his hand on
First P.'s knee_). Now, you b'leeve what I'm a'goin' to tell yer?

_First P. (his dignity a little ruffled)._ I will--if it's anything in
reason.

_The S._ It's this: My opinion of Killivan and Sulton's this--Sulton
_brought_ Killivan _out_. I'm on'y tellin' yer from 'earsay, like; but I
_know_ this myself--one lived in 'Oxton, and the other down Bermondsey
way. 'E's got a nice little butcher's business there at this present
moment; and 'e's a mug if 'e turns it up!

_First P. (axiomatically)._ Every man's a mug who turns a good business
up.

_The S._ Yer right! And (_moralising_) it ain't _all_ 'oney with that
sort o' people, neither, I can tell yer! I dessay, now, when all's put
to the test, you're not a moneyed man--no more than I am myself?

_First P. (not altogether flattered)._ Well--that's as _may_ be.

_The S._ But I b'leeve yer to be a man o' the world, although I don't
_know_ yer.

_First P. (modestly)._ I used to be in it at one time.

_The S. (confidentially)._ I'm in it _now_. I don't get my livin' by it,
though, mind yer. I'm a mechanic, I am--to a certain extent. I've been
in America. _There's_ a country now--they don't over-tax like they do
'ere!

_First P. (sympathetically)._ There you _'ave_ touched a point--we're
taxed past all common sense. Why, this very tobacco I'm smoking now is
charged----

_The S._ Talkin' of terbaccer, I don't mind 'aving a pipe along with yer
myself.

_First P. (handing his pouch with a happy mixture of cordiality and
condescension)._ There you are, then.

_The S. (afflicted by sudden compunction as he fills his pipe)._ I 'ope
I'm not takin' a libbaty in askin yer?

_First P._ Liberty? rubbish! I'm not one to make distinctions where _I_
go. I'd as soon talk to one man as I would another--you're setting your
coat alight.

_The S._ I set fire to myself once, and I never live in 'opes of doing
so agen! It's a funny thing with me, I can smoke a cigar just as well as
I could a short pipe. I'm no lover of a cigar, if you understand me; but
I can go into company where they _are_, d'ye _see_?

_First P. (shortly)._ _I_ see.

_The S. (with fresh misgivings)._ You'll excuse me if I've taken a
libbaty with yer!

_First P. (with a stately air)._ We settled all that just now.

_The S. (after a scrutiny)._ I tell yer what my idear of _you_ is--that
you're a _Toff!_

_First P. (disclaiming this distinction a little uneasily)._ No,
no--there's nothing of the toff about _me!_

_The S. (defiantly)._ Well, you're a _gentleman_, anyway?

_First P. (aphoristic, but uncomfortable)._ We can all of us be that,
so long as we behave ourselves.

_The S. (much pleased by this sentiment)._ Right agen! give us yer
'and--if it's not takin a libbaty. I'm one of them as can't bear to take
a libbaty with no matter 'oo. Yer know it's a real pleasure to me to be
settin' 'ere torkin' comfortably to you, without no thought of either of
us fallin' out. There's some people as wouldn't feel 'appy, not without
they was 'aving a row. Now you and me ain't _like_ that!

_First P. (shifting about)._ Quite so--quite so, of course!

_The S._ Not but what if it was to come to a row between us, I could
take _my_ part!

_First P. (wishing there was somebody else in the compartment)._ I--I
hope we'll keep off that.

_The S. (devoutly)._ So do I! _I_ 'ope we'll keep off o' that. But yer
never know what may bring it on--and there it is, d'ye see! You and me
might fall out without intending it. I've bin a bit of a boxer in my
day. Do you doubt my word?--if so, say it to my face!

_First P._ I've no wish to offend you, I'm sure.

_The S._ I never take a lie straight from any man, and there you 'ave me
in a word! If you're _bent_ on a row, you'll find me a glutton, that's
all I can tell you!

_First P. (giving himself up for lost)._ But I'm _not_ bent on a
row--qu--quite otherwise!

_The S._ You should ha' said so afore, because, when my back's once put
_up_, I'm--'ello! we're stopping, I get out 'ere, don't I?

_First P. (eagerly)._ Yes--make haste, they don't stay long anywhere on
this line!

_The S. (completely mollified)._ Then I'll say good-bye to yer.
(_Tenderly._) P'raps we may meet agen, some day.

_First P._ We--we'll hope so--good day to you, wish you luck!

_The S. (solemnly)._ Lord _love_ yer! (_Pausing at door._) I 'ope you
don't think me the man to fall out with nobody. I _never_ fall out----

_Fem. T. (after a pause)._ As you have no one to present you, I must ask
"if you are any lady's husband?"

_Male T. (with a sigh)._ Alas, no! I am a wretched bachelor!

_Fem. T. (drily)._ That is nothing out of the common. I have been given
to understand that all bachelors are miserable.

_Male T._ No doubt your husband agrees with the opinion?

_Fem. T. (calmly)._ I have no experience. I am a spinster.

_Male T. (smiling)._ Indeed! And you selected a ladies' carriage?

_Fem. T. (quickly)._ Because there was no room anywhere else.

_Male T._ Well, well! At the next station I can get into a smoking
compartment.

_Fem. T._ Surely there is no need to take so much trouble.

_Male T._ Why! don't _you_ object to a cigar?

_Fem. T._ Not in the least. The fact is, I smoke myself!

We have often been struck with the difference of manner assumed by
railway officials towards different people. Shut your eyes, and you can
tell from the tone of their voices whom they are addressing. The
following examples will best illustrate our meaning. The railway
potentate is calling upon the passengers to get their tickets ready. He
calls:

To the Third Class.--_Fortissimè._--"Tickets, tickets; come get
your tickets ready."

To the Second Class.--_Fortè._--"Tickets, gents; get your tickets ready,
gents."

To the First Class.--_Piano._--"Get your tickets ready, gentlemen, if
you please; tickets ready, if you please, gentlemen."

RAILWAY COMPANIONS

(_By a Disagreeable Traveller_)

I.

I have come to the conclusion that the railway train exercises a
sinister influence upon the human race. Persons who are tolerable--or
even welcome--in ordinary daily life, become peculiarly obnoxious so
soon as they enter the compartment of a train. No fairy prince ever
stepped into a railway train--assuming he favoured that means of
locomotion--without being transformed straightway into a Beast, and even
Beauty herself could not be distinguished from her disagreeable
sisters--in a train.

Speaking for myself, railway travelling invariably brings to the surface
all my worst qualities.

My neighbour opposite hazards some remark. I feel immediately a fit of
taciturnity coming over me, and an overpowering inclination to retreat
behind a fortification of journals and magazines. On the other hand, say
that I have exhausted my stock of railway literature--or, no remote
possibility, that the literature has exhausted me--then I make a casual
remark about the weather. The weather is not usually considered a
controversial topic: in railway trains, however, it becomes so.

"Rain! not a bit," says a passenger in the far corner, evidently
meditating a walking tour, and he views me suspiciously as if I were a
rain-producer.

"And a good thing too," remarks the man opposite. "It's wanted badly, I
tell you, sir--very badly. It's all very well for you holiday folk,"
&c., &c.

And all this bad feeling because of my harmless well-intentioned remark.

The window is up. "Phew!... stuffy," says the man opposite. "You don't
mind, I hope, the window--eh?" "Not in the least," I say, and conceive a
deadly hatred for him. I know from experience that directly that window
is down all the winds of heaven will conspire to rush through, bearing
upon them a smoky pall. I resign myself, therefore, to possible
bronchitis and inflammation of the eye. Schoolboys, I may remark by the
way, are the worst window offenders, owing to their diabolical practice
of looking out of window in a tunnel--and, of course, _nothing_ ever
happens to them. What's the use of expostulating after the compartment
is full of yellow, choking vapour. These boys should be leashed together
like dogs and conveyed in the luggage-van.

The window is down. "W-h-oop," coughs an elderly man. "Do you mind, sir,
that window being closed?" Polite mendacity and inward bitterness on my
part towards the individual who has converted the compartment into an
oven.

But there are worse companions even than these, of whom I must speak
another time.

II.

I have known people thoughtlessly speak well of the luncheon-basket. In
my opinion, the luncheon-basket arouses the worst passions of human
nature, and is a direct incentive to deeds of violence. To say this is
to cast an aspersion upon the refreshment contractor, who is evidently a
man of touchingly simple faith and high imagination. Simple faith
assuredly, for does he not provide on the principle that our insides are
hardy and vigorous and unspoilt by the art of cooking? High imagination
most certainly, otherwise he would never call that red fluid by the name
of claret.

No, it is to the social rather than to the gastronomic influence of the
luncheon-basket that I wish to advert.

Once I procured a luncheon-basket and with it came the demon of
discontent and suspicion, converting three neutral people into deadly
enemies.

One was a pale young man who had been scowling over Browning and making
frantic notes on the margin of the book. Personally, I don't think it
quite decent for pale young men to improve their minds in a public
conveyance--but at any rate he had seemed harmless. Now he raised his
eyes and viewed me with undisguised contempt. "Wretched glutton," he
said in effect, and when accidentally I burned my mouth with mustard
(which a sudden swerve had sent meandering in a yellow stream across the
chicken and ham), he gave a sneering, callous smile, which reminded me
that a man may smile and smile and be a--railway companion.

I verily believe that youth to be capable of any crime, even Extension
lecturing.

Then there was a young lady reading a sixpenny Braddon, who viewed me as
if I were some monster; when I shut my eyes and gulped off
some--er--claret, she brought biscuits and lemonade from a small bag and
refreshed herself with ostentatious simplicity, as if to say, "Look upon
_this_ picture and on the wine-bibbing epicurean in the corner." An old
lady with her was more amply provided for (old ladies usually take more
care of their insides than anyone else in creation), but although she
munched sandwiches and washed them down with sherry (probably sweet,
ugh!) luxuriously, she looked with pious horror at my plates and dishes
spread out. I _might_ have said, "Madam, I eat frankly and openly; my
resources may be viewed by all. Your secret and delusive bags have
limitless resources that you are ashamed to show."

I didn't say so; but the restraint placed on myself quite spoilt the
lunch. No more baskets.

ON THE PLATFORM

_A Lady of Family._ Oh, yes, I do travel third-class sometimes, my dear.
I consider it a duty to try to know something of the lower orders.

  [_Looks out for an empty third-class compartment._

EN ROUTE

_The seats are now all occupied: the Lady of Family is in one corner,
next to a Chatty Woman with a basket, and opposite to an
Eccentric-looking Man with a flighty manner._

_The Eccentric Man (to the Lady of Family)._ Sorry to disturb you, mum,
but you're a-setting on one o' my 'am sandwiches.

_The L. of F._???!!!

_The E. M. (considerately)._ Don't trouble yourself, mum, it's of no
intrinsic value. I on'y put it there to keep my seat.

_The Chatty W. (to the L. of F.)._ I think I've seen you about
Shinglebeach, 'ave I not?

_The L. of F._ It is very possible. I have been staying with some
friends in the neighbourhood.

_The C. W._ It's a nice cheerful place is Shinglebeach; but
(_confidentially_) don't you think it's a very sing'ler thing that in a
place like that--a fash'nable place, too--there shouldn't be a single
'am an' beef shop?

_The L. of F. (making a desperate effort to throw herself into the
question)._ What a very extraordinary thing, to be sure! Dear, _dear_
me! No ham and beef shop!

_The C. W._ It's so indeed, mum; and what's more, as I dare say you've
noticed for yourself, if you 'appen to want a snack o' fried fish ever
so, there isn't a place you could go to--leastways, at a moment's
notice. Now, 'ow do you explain such a thing as that?

_The L. of F. (faintly)._ I'm afraid I can't suggest any explanation.

_A Sententious Man._ Fried fish is very sustaining.

  [_Relapses into silence for the remainder of journey._

_The Eccentric Man._ Talking of sustaining, I remember, when we was
kids, my father ud bring us home two pennorth o' ches'nuts, and we 'ad
'em boiled, and they'd last us days. (_Sentimentally._) He was a kind
man, my father (_to the L. of F., who bows constrainedly_), though you
wouldn't ha' thought it, to look at him. I don't say, mind yer, that he
wasn't fond of his bit o' booze--(_the L. of F. looks out of
window_)--like the best of us. I'm goin' up to prove his will now, I
am--if you don't believe me, 'ere's the probate. (_Hands that document
round for inspection._) That's all reg'lar enough, I 'ope. (_To the L.
of F._) Don't give it back before you've done with it--I'm in no 'urry,
and there's good reading in it. (_Points out certain favourite passages
with a very dirty forefinger._) Begin there--_that's_ my name.

  [_The L. of F. peruses the will with as great a show of interest as she
  can bring herself to assume._

_The Eccentric Man._ D'ye see that big 'andsome building over there?
That's the County Lunatic Asylum--where my poor wife is shut up. I went
to see her last week, I did. (_Relates his visit in detail to the L. of
F., who listens unwillingly._) It's wonderful how many of our family
have been in that asylum from first to last. I 'ad a aunt who died
cracky; and my old mother, she's very peculiar at times. There's days
when I feel as if I was a little orf my own 'ed, so if I say anything at
all out of the way, you'll know what it is.

  [_L. of F. changes carriages at the next station. In the second carriage
are two Men of seafaring appearance, and a young Man who is parting from
his Fiancée as the L. of F. takes her seat._

_The Fiancé._ Excuse me one moment, ma'am.

(_Leans across the L. of F. and out of the window._)

Well, goodbye, my girl; take care of yourself.

_The Fiancée (with a hysterical giggle)._ Oh, I'll take care o' _my_
self.

  [_Looks at the roof of the carriage._

_He (with meaning)._ No more pickled onions, eh?

_She._ What a one you are to remember things! (_After a pause._) Give my
love to Joe.

_He._ All right. Well, Jenny, just one, for the last (_they embrace
loudly, after which the F. resumes his seat with an expression of
mingled sentiment and complacency_). Oh, (_to L. of F._) if you don't
mind my stepping across you again, mum. Jenny, if you see Dick between
this and Friday, just tell him as----

  [_Prolonged whispers; sounds of renewed kisses;_

_Final parting as train starts with a jerk which throws the Fiancé upon
the L. of F.'s lap. After the train is started a gleam of peculiar
significance is observable in the eyes of one of the Seafaring Men, who
is reclining in an easy attitude on the seat. His companion responds
with a grin of intelligence, and produces a large black bottle from the
rack. They drink, and hand the bottle to the Fiancé._

_The F._ Thankee I don't mind if I do. Here's wishing you----

  [_Remainder of sentiment drowned in sound of glug-glug-glug; is about to
  hand back bottle when the first Seafarer intimates that he is to pass it
  on. The L. of F. recoils in horror._

_Both Seafarers (reassuringly)._ It's _wine_, mum!

  [_Tableau. The Lady of Family realises that the study of third-class
humanity has its drawbacks._

THE PORTER'S SLAM

[A meeting at Manchester raised a protest against the nuisance caused by
the needlessly loud "slamming" of railway carriage doors.]

  The porter has a patent "slam,"
    Which smites one like a blow,
  And everywhere that porter comes
    That "slam" is sure to go.
  It strikes upon the tym-pa-num
    Like shock of dynamite;
  By day it nearly makes you dumb--
    It deafens you at night.
  When startled by the patent "slam"
    The pious "pas-sen-jare,"
  Says something else that ends in "am"
    (Or he has patience rare).
  Not only does it cause a shock,
    But--Manchester remarks--
  "Depreciates the rolling stock,"
    Well, that is rather larks!
  _That's_ not the point. The porter's slam
    Conduces to insanity,
  And, though as mild as Mary's lamb,
    Drives men to loud profanity.
  If Manchester the "slam" can stay
    By raising of a stir,
  All railway-travellers will say,
    "Bully for Man-ches-ter!"

MR. PIPS HIS DIARY

_Tuesday, July 31, 1849._--Prevailed upon by my wife to carry her to
Bath, as she said, to go see her aunt Dorothy, but I know she looked
more to the pleasure of her trip than any thing else; nevertheless I do
think it necessary policy to keep in with her aunt, who is an old maid
and hath a pretty fortune; and to see what court and attention I pay her
though I do not care 2_d._ about her! But am mightily troubled to know
whether she hath sunk her money in an annuity, which makes me somewhat
uneasy at the charge of our journey, for what with fare, cab-hire, and
vails to Dorothy's servants for their good word, it did cost me
altogether _£_6 2_s._ 6_d._ To the Great Western station in a cab, by
reason of our luggage; for my wife must needs take so many trunks and
bandboxes, as is always the way with women: or else we might have gone
there for 2_s._ 6_d._ less in an omnibus. Did take our places in the
first class notwithstanding the expense, preferring both the seats and
the company; and also because if any necks or limbs are broken I note it
is generally in the second and third classes. So we settled, and the
carriage-doors slammed to, and the bell rung, the train with a whistle
off like a shot, and in the carriage with me and my wife a mighty pretty
lady, a Frenchwoman, and I did begin to talk French with her, which my
wife do not well understand, and by and by did find the air too much for
her where she was sitting, and would come and take her seat between us,
I know, on purpose. So fell a reading the _Times_, till one got in at
Hanwell, who seemed to be a physician, and mighty pretty discourse with
him touching the manner of treating madmen and lunatics, which is now by
gentle management, and is a great improvement on the old plan of chains
and the whip. Also of the foulness of London for want of fit drainage,
and how it do breed cholera and typhus, as sure as rotten cheese do
mites, and of the horrid folly of making a great gutter of the river. So
to Swindon station, where the train do stop ten minutes for refreshment,
and there my wife hungry, and I too with a good appetite,
notwithstanding the discourse about London filth. So we out, and to the
refreshment-room with a crowd of passengers, all pushing, and jostling,
and trampling on each others' toes, striving which should get served
first. With much ado got a basin of soup for my wife, and for myself a
veal and ham pie, and to see me looking at my watch and taking a
mouthful by turns; and how I did gulp a glass of Guinness his stout!
Before we had half finished, the guard rang the bell, and my wife with a
start, did spill her soup over her dress, and was obliged to leave half
of it; and to think how ridiculous I looked, scampering back to the
train with my meat-pie in my mouth! To run hurry-skurry at the sound of
a bell, do seem only fit for a gang of workmen; and the bustle of
railways do destroy all the dignity of travelling; but the world
altogether is less grand, and do go faster than formerly. Off again, and
to the end of our journey, troubled at the soup on my wife's dress, but
thankful I had got my change, and not left it behind me at the Swindon
station.

  Thy whistle weird perchance may be

said that elderly gentleman, "'ave you seen my old hall?" "Got an old
hall!" murmured Jones to himself. "Rich man--probably duke! Should like
to cultivate him!"

2. The stranger was affable. "Did you ever 'ave an old hall?" he said.
"Why--er--n-no," said Jones. "Very convenient thing to 'ave," said the
stranger. "I've got all manner o' things in my old hall." "Ah--armour,
and ancestors, and tapestry, and secret doors, no doubt," thought Jones
to himself.

3. "You must see my old hall," said the stranger. "I'll show you all the
ins and outs of it. I can put you up----" "Really very good of you!"
exclaimed Jones. "Shall be delighted to accept----" "Put you up to no
hend of wrinkles about old halls," continued the stranger.

4. They alighted at the terminus. "There--there's my old hall! Hain't it
a beauty?" said the stranger. Jones sank slowly to the earth, without a
groan. That ungrammatical stranger's vaunted possession was a hold-all.

RULES FOR THE RAIL

A REMINISCENCE OF THE BAD OLD DAYS

The President of the Board of Trade having sent a circular to the
railway companies with reference to making provisions for the prevention
of accidents and the enforcement of punctuality, especially in
connection with the running of excursion trains at this period of the
year, the following regulations will probably come under consideration.

1. In future one line will be kept (when feasible) for up trains, whilst
the other is reserved for the use of down-trains. This rule will not
apply to luggage and mineral trains, and trains inaccurately shunted on
to lines on which they (the trains) have no right to travel.

2. Station-masters should never permit a train to start more than forty
minutes late, except when very busy with the company's accounts.

3. As complaints have been made that signalmen are overworked, these
officers in future will occupy their boxes during the morning only.
During the rest of the day the boxes will be closed. That the public may
suffer no inconvenience by this arrangement, the trains will continue
running by day and by night as heretofore.

4. A pointsman will be expected to notice all signals and to obey them.
He will be required, before leaving his post (when on duty), to order
one of his children to look after the points during his absence. The
child he selects for this office should be at least three years old.

5. The driver and stoker in charge of an engine should never sleep at
the same time unless they have taken proper precautions beforehand to
prevent an excessive consumption of the company's fuel.

6. When a luggage train is loading or unloading beside the platform of a
station, it will be desirable to recollect the time at which an express
is due, as unnecessary collisions cause much damage to the rolling
stock, and not unfrequently grave inconvenience to first-class
passengers.

7. The _débris_ of a train should be removed from the rails before an
express is permitted to enter the tunnel in which an accident has taken
place. As non-compliance with this rule is likely to cause much delay to
the traffic, it should be obeyed when feasible.

8. As guards of excursion trains have been proved to be useless, their
places will in future be filled by surgeons. Passengers are particularly
requested to give no fees to the surgeons accompanying these trains, as
the salaries of these officials will be provided for in the prices
charged to the public for excursion tickets.

9. In future, contracts from surgeons and chemists will be accepted on
the same terms as those already received from refreshment caterers.

10. The public having frequently experienced inconvenience in having to
leave the station when requiring medical attention, in future the
waiting-rooms of the third-class passengers will be converted into
surgeries for first-class passengers. As these saloons will be fitted
with all the latest inventions in surgical instruments, a small extra
charge will be made to passengers using them.

11. The directors (in conclusion) fully recognising the responsibility
conferred upon them by the shareholders, if not by the public, will
expel from their body in future (as a person evidently of unsound mind)
any director convicted of travelling by any railway.

BLACKFRIARS TO SLOANE SQUARE

  The man who got in at Blackfriars
  Was smoking the foulest of briars,

    Could I give him a light?--
  Hadn't got one--well, all men are liars.

  I've frequently noticed the Temple
  Is a place there are not enough rhymes to;
    And that's why I've made
    This verse somewhat blank,
  And rather disregarded the metre.

  How _do_ you pronounce Charing Cross?
  It's a point where I'm quite at a loss.
    Some people, of course,
    Would rhyme it with "horse,"
  But I always rhyme it with "hoss."

SOMEBODY'S LUGGAGE

If you see half-a-dozen new patent leather covered basket-trunks with a
name written upon all of them, in staring white characters, accompanied
by a gigantic portmanteau and three hat-boxes, you may know that the
Honourable Lionel and Rowena Silverspoon have started on their
wedding-tour.

If you see a weather-beaten portmanteau, accompanied by a neat little
trunk and a pretty little birdcage, you may know that Edwin and Angelina
Dovecot are going to Ventnor for the honeymoon.

If you see a big carpet-bag, accompanied by a large white umbrella and a
tin colour-box, you may know that Daub, A. R. A., is going to Brittany in
search of subjects.

hurriedly for Spain.

If you see a small bundle, accompanied by a pair of handcuffs, you may
know that urgent public affairs have induced Sergeant Smart (of the
Detective Police) to follow the same _route_ taken by Captain Bubble _en
voyage_ for Spain.

If you see twenty-four patent reversible extra waterproof holdalls, with
all the latest improvements, painted blue, green, yellow, and red, and

cases, you may know that Colonel Jerusalem R. X. E. Squash, U.S.A., and
family are engaged in "doing" Europe.

old portmanteau and a double perambulator, you may know that Mr. and
Mrs. Paterfamilias and children are going to Herne Bay for a month.

you may know that _Mr. Punch_ is off to Switzerland to enjoy himself.

THE ROUGH'S RAILWAY GUIDE

[Illustration]

The ready rough may always regard a third-class carriage, or indeed, any
carriage he can make his way into with or without a ticket, on the
Underground Railway as a sort of travelling Alsatia, where brutal
blackguardism finds "sanctuary."

The one duty of a guard--as of a watch--is to "keep time." He is not
expected to keep anything else, except tips. For instance he is not
bound to keep his temper, or to keep on the look out for roughs.

No one has a legal right to get into a carriage which is full, but then
a third-class carriage never is full so long as one more brawny brute
can violently force his way into it.

When bent upon enjoying the exceptional privileges and immunities
reserved for blackguardism by the Underground Gallios, it is only
necessary for a few hulking ruffians, big of course, and half drunk by
preference, to thrust themselves violently in some compartment
containing no less than twice its legal complement. In doing this they
will, of course, rudely trample the toes of weak women, and insolently
dislodge the hats of inoffensive men; thus paving the way pleasantly for
future operations.

Having squeezed themselves in somehow, they can then further indulge in
the lesser amenities of travel by puffing rank tobacco smoke in the
faces of their fellow-passengers, expectorating at large with not too
nice a reference to direction, and indulging in howling, chaff, and
horse-play of the most offensive character.

The addition of blasphemy, especially if there should be women and
children present, may probably provoke a mild remonstrance from some
one, and then the rough's opportunity has arrived at last.

To particularise the rough's rules for dealing with such an objector and
his sympathisers--if any--would be as tedious as superfluous; but the
combined arts of the low pugilist, the intoxicated wife-beater, and the
Lancashire "purler," may be called into play, with much enjoyment and
perfect safety, until the object of his wrath is beaten into
unconsciousness or kicked into convulsions. On reaching a station, the
frightened passengers may perhaps dare to appeal to the guard! That
autocratic official will of course, with much angry hustling and
holloaing, declare that _he_ can't stop to interfere, _his_ business
being, not to stay actual violence or prevent possible homicide, but to
"keep time," and the ruffianly scoundrels go off shouting and singing
"_Rule Britannia_" and telling their pals "what a bloomin' lark they've
had in the Hunderground."
